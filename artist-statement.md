# Artist Statement

My name tag is inspired by **Ellsworth Kelly**'s artwork and the splash screen used by **JetBrains** products. The sketch program utilizes random functions and loops to create a colorful background composed of circles and different arcs, meanwhile, each of them is randomly colored within my choice of palette. 

I'm trying to communicate my personality of enthusiasm for life, curiosity for new things as well as respect for diversity through the name tag. I want to make the viewer feel my passion and the idea of never sticking to one pattern. 

I also practice some fundamental concepts in modernism, like the additive composition of similar elements and the use of chance. These are reflected in the random shapes and colors.

Despite the complexity of the background, I manage to balance between interestingness and readability. As for the text of my name, I intentionally put it in a boomerang shape area, with my names “YUXUAN” and “LIN” sharing a common letter “N” in between, which is interesting. Eventually, to enhance the readability of my name on my profile, I add a golden stroke to the text, which I get inspiration from the *Shang-Chi* logo.
